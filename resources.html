                <p>
                    If there is a poster species for the worldwide epidemic of plastic pollution, it’s sea turtles. 
                    The mothers swim through islands of plastic on their migrations and crawl through plastic to 
                    find their spots to nest on beaches. Nests are impacted by toxic microplastic particles and 
                    hatchlings crawl back through macroplastic on their way to the water. They confuse plastic bags 
                    and balloons for their favorite food, jellyfish. Straws can get stuck...

                <h4>Why Healthy Oceans Need Sea Turtles</h4>
                <p>
                    Sea turtles have played vital roles in maintaining the health of the world’s oceans for more than 
                    100 million years. These roles range from maintaining productive coral reef ecosystems to transporting 
                    essential nutrients from the oceans to beaches and coastal dunes.

                    Major changes have occurred in the oceans because sea turtles have been virtually eliminated from many 
                    areas of the globe. Commercial fishing, loss of...

                <h4>What do sea turtles eat? Unfortunately, plastic bags.</h4>
                <p>
                    Would you rather pick a fight with a jellyfish or a plastic bag? For sea turtles, this question
                    should be simple. Their scales protect them from the worst of a jellyfish's venom, and the resulting
                    meal is both tasty and nutritious. But a single piece of plastic can be deadly. The problem is that
                    sea turtles don’t know what plastic is, and they don’t get to choose...

                    The Problem: Over 1 million marine animals (including mammals, fish, sharks, turtles, and birds) are 
                    killed each year due to plastic debris in the ocean (UNESCO Facts & Figures on Marine Pollution). 
                    Currently, it is estimated that there are 100 million tons of plastic in oceans around the world. 
                    It is expected that another 60 billion pounds will be produced this year alone. In some areas, the 
                    buildup of plastics is estimated to span...

                <h4>Sea turtles are eating ocean plastic because it smells like food, study finds</h4>
                <p>
                    Across the world, sea turtles are swallowing bits of plastic in the ocean and often dying as a result. 

                    There are many theories about why sea turtles and other marine animals ingest plastic. Some people have 
                    long speculated that they mistake it for food due to its appearance — for instance, turtles will eat a 
                    plastic bag that looks like a jelly fish.

                    But scientists from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill realized these...
